      <h2>Case Study: Decodable Text for Early Readers</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Kindergarten decodable story<br />
        <strong>Objective:</strong> Support emerging readers with a phonics‑aligned narrative<br />
        <strong>Role:</strong> Writer and instructional designer</p>

        <h3>Overview &amp; Constraints</h3>
        <p>The goal of this project was to create a short, engaging story aligned with a specific phonics pattern while maintaining age‑appropriate vocabulary and narrative appeal. Working with a kindergarten teacher, I targeted short <em>a</em> and short <em>i</em> CVC words and high‑frequency sight words (“the,” “is,” “a”) to support decoding skills. Target words included cat, hat, mat, sit, Sam, can, tap, it, in, pin, nap and big.</p>

        <h3>Draft &amp; Revision</h3>
        <p>The first draft introduced Sam the cat and his big hat:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Sam the cat had a hat.<br />
          The hat was big.<br />
          Sam sat on a mat.<br />
          Can Sam nap in the hat?<br />
          Tap, tap! It is a pin!<br />
          A pin is in the hat!<br />
          Sam can not nap.<br />
          The pin is bad.<br />
          Sam hid the pin.<br />
          Now Sam can nap.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>To enhance clarity and instructional value, I revised the piece to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduce target words with predictable structure and repetition.</li>
          <li>Use humour and surprise (“Tap, tap! It is a pin!”) to increase engagement.</li>
          <li>Provide opportunities for high‑frequency sight word recognition.</li>
          <li>Add scaffolding through rhythmic sentence patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructional Features</h3>
        <p>The final story supported decoding, vocabulary development and comprehension skills appropriate for kindergarten. Teachers used the piece in small group instruction and literacy centres to reinforce:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identifying main ideas and retelling the sequence of events.</li>
          <li>Practising CVC decoding in context.</li>
          <li>Asking and answering questions about the text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Relevance to Netflix’s Kids Content Design</h3>
        <p>This case study highlights my ability to align language with instructional goals while maintaining narrative appeal – an essential skill when designing copy and UI for children. The Netflix job calls for content designers who can communicate clearly across product interfaces and understand the needs of younger audiences【190111282298050†L170-L199】. My experience creating decodable text demonstrates a systematic approach to language frameworks and a sensitivity to developmental stages.</p>
