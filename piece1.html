      <h2>Children’s Book: Mimi Mariposa</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Children’s narrative story<br />
        <strong>Audience:</strong> Early elementary readers<br />
        <strong>Role:</strong> Author and designer of concept & narrative voice</p>

        <p>Mimi Mariposa isn’t an ordinary kid – she finds beauty in the places most people forget to notice. Dew drops on grass, the shimmer of soap bubbles, the secrets in an old cookie tin: everything is a source of wonder when you slow down and stay curious.</p>
        <p>While helping her Abuelita clean the pantry, Mimi discovers a letter in a tin of cinnamon cookies. The shimmering ink invites her to seek a glowing stone buried beneath the roses, passed down through generations to girls with a kind and brave <em>corazón</em>. With the help of her wise cat Chispa, she uncovers a ring glowing a brave pink – the colour of morning and new beginnings – and learns that the real magic isn’t in the stone at all, but in her own strength and the love of her family.</p>
        <p>The next day she proudly shares the story at school. Even her teacher whispers “¡Ay, qué brillante!” – Mimi’s favourite words for something wonderfully unexpected. Later, Abuelita’s knowing wink reveals she was the <em>Guardiana de la Galleta</em> all along. Wearing the ring reminds Mimi that her grandma will always be with her, and that courage and curiosity are family treasures worth passing on.</p>

        <h3>Why It Works</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Encourages observation and curiosity:</strong> The story invites young readers to look closely at everyday moments and find magic in small details.</li>
          <li><strong>Celebrates family and tradition:</strong> Mimi’s connection to her Abuelita anchors the narrative in intergenerational love and hidden strength.</li>
          <li><strong>Empowers the reader:</strong> Mimi’s realization that the magic is inside her models self‑confidence for children.</li>
          <li><strong>Bilingual authenticity:</strong> Spanish words and phrases, like “¡Ay, qué brillante!” and “Vamos, Chispa,” add cultural richness and rhythm.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Relevance to Netflix’s Kids Content Design</h3>
        <p>This story demonstrates my ability to craft a playful, child‑centred narrative voice that balances wonder with emotional depth – a key requirement for the <em>Senior Content Designer – Kids</em> role. Like the job description’s emphasis on creating intuitive, child‑friendly experiences and designing scalable language frameworks【190111282298050†L156-L166】, this piece shows how I use language, tone and pacing to engage young readers while supporting comprehension and representation.</p>
