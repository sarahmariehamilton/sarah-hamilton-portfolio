      <h2>UX Writing for a Kids Digital Reading App</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Prototype UX copy for digital literacy app<br />
        <strong>Audience:</strong> Early readers aged 5–7<br />
        <strong>Role:</strong> UX writer collaborating with product management and design</p>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>In partnership with a product manager and designer, I developed voice and messaging for a prototype reading app designed to help early readers navigate reading tasks independently. The goal was to scaffold comprehension and encourage positive learning habits through clear, child‑friendly language.</p>

        <h3>Sample Flow &amp; Copy</h3>
        <p>Each message below aligns with a specific UX goal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Welcome screen (inspire excitement &amp; safety):</strong> “Hi, reader! Let’s play with words today. Tap <em>Start</em> when you’re ready!”</li>
          <li><strong>Reading prompt (clarify the task):</strong> “Read the sentence. Then choose the picture that matches.”</li>
          <li><strong>Success feedback (celebrate effort):</strong> “Nice thinking! You picked the best match!”</li>
          <li><strong>Error message (encourage persistence):</strong> “Oops! Try again. Look at the sentence one more time.”</li>
          <li><strong>End of session (leave on a high note):</strong> “You did it! Want to play another round or take a break?”</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
        <p>Every line of copy was written with comprehension, encouragement and developmental appropriateness in mind. During testing with classroom educators and young users, we revised language to reduce cognitive load and celebrate small wins. Tone was friendly and reassuring, using decodable vocabulary where possible.</p>

        <h3>Relevance to Netflix’s Kids Content Design</h3>
        <p>The Netflix role emphasises partnering with product designers to define and lead projects, establishing voice &amp; tone, and creating information architecture【190111282298050†L170-L177】. This project demonstrates my ability to collaborate cross‑functionally, prototype and iterate on language frameworks, and write copy that guides children through digital experiences with clarity and warmth. I’m comfortable presenting strategy to stakeholders and iterating based on user feedback – all skills highlighted in the job description.</p>
